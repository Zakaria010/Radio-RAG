    "context": "potential for interference to other networks does not exist (i.e. off the edge of the Earth, unpopulated ocean regions, etc.). 2.1 Representation of coverage area Various methods have been proposed in the past for the service area representation of FSS antennas. In one method, the angular distance outside the coverage area is measured in a direction normal to the service area geography (constant gain contour) as seen from the satellite. In practice, the gain contour is designed to fit the service area as closely as possible and therefore the difference between using the service area and the constant gain contour is expected to be very small. However, difficulties will arise with this method in certain cases where portions of gain contours are concave such as with crescent shaped patterns. For such patterns, the orthogonal direction away from the contour could intersect the coverage area again thereby causing ambiguity (see Fig. 3a)). Another difficulty with this representation is that for a given location outside the coverage area, there could be more than one point on the service area at which the line joining the observation location to the point on the service area is normal to the service area contour at that point (see Fig. 3a)). However, a method has been developed which circumvents the difficulties cited above using angular measurements normal to the coverage area and patterns containing concavities. This method involves a number of graphical constructions and is described in a set of step-by-step procedures in Annex 2. In addition, these step-by-step procedures can be simplified by use of a convex-only coverage contour. To produce a convex-only coverage contour, the same procedure as described in Annex 2 is undertaken, except that only convex corners, i.e. those in which the circle lies inside the coverage contour are considered.

Considering an illumination function of the form: which is zero at the aperture edge for N(cid:33)0. The elemental beamlet radius, as a function of the side- lobe level (dB) and the D/(cid:79)ratio, is, over the range of interest, approximately given by: where Ls is the relative level of the first side lobe (dB). This expression illustrates the trade-off between antenna diameter, side-lobe level and steepness of the main lobe skirt regions. It is derived by curve fitting the results obtained from calculations for different side-lobe levels.

Previous modelling did not appear to quantify the beam broadening effects. The following models include two separate approaches which deal with these effects, which are essential to predicting shaped beam antenna performance accurately. 2.4.1 First model The shaped beam pattern given in this section is in terms of the primary as well as the secondary parameters. The primary parameters are the beamlet size, coverage area width in the direction of interest and the peak side-lobe level.

    "context": "offset height to the edge of the reflector. Equation (9) clearly demonstrates the dependence of beam broadening on number of beams scanned and the satellite antenna F/Dp ratio. This expression is valid for (cid:71) as high as nine beamwidths, which is more than sufficient for global coverage even at 14/11GHz band; for service areas as large as Canada, United States or China the value of (cid:71)is generally one to two beams at 6/4GHz band and about four beams at 14/11GHz band, in the application of this model. Thus, for most of the systems the value of Qis normally less than 1.1. That is, the beam broadening effect is generally about 10% of the width of the elemental beamlet of the shaped-beam antenna. Neglecting the main beam broadening due to blockage and reflector surface error, and assuming a worst-case value of 0.35 for F/Dp ratio of the reflector, the beam broadening factor Q can be simplified as: In the 6/4 GHz band, a –25dB side-lobe level can be achieved with little difficulty using a multi-horn solid reflector antenna of about 2 m in diameter, consistent with a PAM-D type launch. To achieve 30 dB discrimination, a larger antenna diameter could be required if a sizeable angular range is to be protected or controlled. In the 14/11 GHz fixed-satellite bands, 30 dB discrimination can generally be achieved with the 2 m antenna and the use of a more elaborate feed design. The above equations for the reference pattern are dependent upon the scan angle of the component beam at the edge of coverage in the direction of each individual cut for which the pattern is to be applied. For a reference pattern to be used as a design objective, a simple pattern with minimum parametric dependence is desirable. Hence, a value or"

First a simple test is applied. Draw a straight line across the coverage concavity so that it touches the coverage edge at two points without crossing it anywhere. Draw normals to the coverage contour at the tangential points. If the point under consideration lies outside the coverage area between the two normals, the antenna discrimination at that point may be affected by the coverage concavity. It is then necessary to proceed as follows: Determine the smallest angle (cid:39)(cid:92) between the point under consideration and the coverage area contour. Construct a circle with radius ((cid:92)b(cid:14)(cid:39)(cid:92)(cid:12), whose circumference contains the point, in such a way that its angular distance from any point on the coverage area contour is maximized when the circle lies entirely outside the coverage area; call this maximum angular distance (cid:39)(cid:92)(cid:99).

    "context": "levels presented in Tables 1 and 2 are based on assumed integration times of 2000 s. Integration times actually used in astronomical observations cover a wide range of values. Continuum observations made with single-antenna telescopes (as distinct from interferometric arrays) are well represented by the integration time of 2000 s, typical of good quality observations. On the other hand 2000 s is less representative of spectral line observations. Improvements in receiver stability and the increased use of correlation spectrometers have allowed more frequent use of longer integration times required to observe weak spectral lines, and spectral line observations lasting several hours are quite common. A more representative integration time for these observations would be 10 h. For a 10 h integration, the threshold interference level is 6 dB more stringent than the values given in Table 2. There are also certain observations of time varying phenomena, e.g. observations of pulsars, stellar or solar bursts, and interplanetary scintillations for which much shorter time periods may be adequate. 1.3 Antenna response pattern Interference to radio astronomy is almost always received through the antenna side lobes, so the main beam response to interference need not be considered. The side-lobe model for large paraboloid antennas in the frequency range 2 to 30 GHz, given in Recommendation ITU-R SA.509is a good approximation of the response of many radioastronomy antennas and is adopted throughout this Recommendation as the radio astronomy reference antenna. In this model, the side-lobe level decreases with angular distance (degrees) from the main beam axis and is equal to 32 – 25 log (cid:77) (dBi) for 1° (cid:31) (cid:77) (cid:31) 48°.

However, it is useful to calculate the threshold levels of interference strength for a particular value of side-lobe gain, that we choose as 0 dBi, and use in Tables 1 to 3. From the model, this side-lobe level occurs at an angle of 19.05(cid:113) from the main beam axis. Then a signal at the detrimental threshold level defined for 0 dBi side-lobe gain will exceed the criterion for the detrimental level at the receiver input if it is incident at the antenna at an angle of less than 19.05(cid:113). The solid angle Rec. ITU-R RA.769-2 5 within a cone of angular radius 19.05(cid:113)is 0.344 sr, which is equal to 5.5% of the 2(cid:83)sr of the sky above the horizon that a radio telescope is able to observe at any given time. Thus if the probability of the angle of incidence of interference is uniformly distributed over the sky, about 5.5% of interfering signals would be incident within 19.05(cid:113) of the main beam axis of an antenna pointed towards the sky. Note also that the 5.5% figure is in line with the recommended levels of data lossto radio astronomy observations in percentage of time, specified in Recommen- dationITU-RRA.1513. The particular case of non-GSO satellites presents a dynamic situation, that is, the positions of the satellites relative to the beam of the radio astronomy antenna show large changes within the time scale of the 2000 s integration time. Analysis of interference in this case requires integrating the response over the varying side-lobe levels, for example, using the concept of epfd defined in No.22.5C of the Radio Regulations (RR). In addition it is usually necessary to combine the responses to a number of satellites within a particular system. In such calculations"

Consequently, in Table 1 (continuum observations), (cid:39)f is assumed to be the width of the allocated radio astronomy bands for frequencies up to 71GHz. Above 71 GHz a value of 8 GHz is used, which is a representative bandwidth generally used on radio astronomy receivers in this range. In Table 2 (spectral line observations) a channel bandwidth (cid:39)fequal to the Doppler shift corresponding to 3km/s in velocity is used for entries below 71 GHz. This value represents a compromise between the desired high spectral resolution and the sensitivity. There are a very large number of astrophysically important lines above 71 GHz, as shown in Recommendation ITU-R RA.314and only a few representative values for the detrimental levels are given in Table 2 for the range 71-275 GHz. The channel bandwidth used to compute the detrimental levels above 71 GHz is 1000kHz (1 MHz)in all cases. This value was chosen for practical reasons. While it is slightly wider than the spectral channel width customary in radio astronomy receivers at these frequencies, it is used as the standard reference bandwidth for space services above 15 GHz. 1.5 Receiver noise temperature and antenna temperature The receiver noise temperatures in Tables 1 and 2 are representative of the systems in use in radio astronomy.

They include the effects of the ionosphere or the neutral atmosphere, ground pickup in side lobes resulting from spillover or scattering, ohmic losses, and the cosmic microwave background. At frequencies above 100 GHz the atmospheric losses due to water vapour in the neutral atmosphere become very important. For these frequencies the values given are typical of the terrestrial sites used for major millimetric-wave radio astronomy facilities, such as Mauna Kea, Hawaii, or the Llano de Chajnantor at an elevation of 5000 m in Chile, which is the site chosen for a major international radio astronomy array for frequencies in the range 30 GHz to 1 THz. 2 Special cases The levels given in Tables 1 and 2 are applicable to terrestrial sources of interfering signals.

    "context": "antenna, such as described in Recommen- dationITU-R SA.509, is pointed within 19.05° of a satellite radiating at levels in accordance with those listed in the Tables. A series of such transmitters located around the GSO would preclude radio astronomy observations with high sensitivity from a band of sky 38.1° wide and centred on the orbit. The loss of such a large area of sky would impose severe restrictions on radioastronomy observations. In general, it would not be practical to suppress the unwanted emissions from satellites to below the detrimental level when the main beam of a radio telescope is pointed directly towards the satellite. A workable solution is suggested by observing the projection of the GSO in celestial coordinates as viewed from the latitudes of a number of major radio astronomy observations (see Recommendation ITU-R RA.517). If it were possible to point a radio telescope to within 5° of the GSO without encountering detrimental interference, then for that telescope a band of sky 10° wide would be unavailable for high-sensitivity observations. For a given observatory this would be a serious loss. However, for a combination of radio telescopes located at northern and southern latitudes, operating at the same frequencies, the entire sky would be accessible. A value of 5° should therefore be regarded as the requirement for minimum angular spacing between the main beam of a radio astronomy antenna and the GSO. In the model antenna response of Recommendation ITU-R SA.509, the side-lobe level at an angle of 5° from the main beam is 15 dBi. Thus, to avoid interference detrimental to a radio telescope meeting the antenna side-lobe performance of Recommendation ITU-R SA.509, pointed to within 5° of the transmitter, it is desirable that the satellite emissions be reduced 15 dB below the pfdgiven in Tables 1 and 2."

Annex 2 Migration to narrow-band channels in the maritime mobile service 1 Introduction This Annex considers how in future the maritime-mobile service might migrate to narrow-band channels spaced at 5 kHz or 6.25 kHz apart, using linear or digital modulation. Consideration is given to migration from 25 kHz channel spacing as used at present, and from 12.5 kHz if the latter was to be implemented as an interim measure by some administrations. 2 Implications of migration to narrow-band channels 2.1 Migration The most practicable and least disruptive method of migrating from 25 kHz or 12.5 kHz to 5 kHz or 6.25kHz would be by interleaving the narrow-band channels with the wider ones and a similar technique can be used in all cases. However because the linear and digital modulation techniques using 5 kHz and/or 6.25 kHz are incompatible with current FM equipment, dual mode or additional equipment would be required during the change-over period. 2.2 Interleaving 2.2.1 Interleaving with 25 kHz channels Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how 5 kHz and 6.25 kHz channels could be interleaved with the existing 25kHz ones. During the change-over period, coast stations and ships would be required to equip with narrow-band equipment and move to the new narrow-band channels as they became available. The numbers of new narrow-band channels would be gradually increased during the transition period with the number of 25 kHz channels available correspondingly decreasing. On a specified date all remaining 25 kHz channels would be withdrawn to be replaced by new ones. The migration from 25 kHz channels is fairly straightforward but some realignment of channel or band edges is likely to be required.

However, a direct transition from 25 kHz rather than via an interim step of 12.5 kHz would be simpler in that: – it would require less channel planning and realignment of centre frequencies; – it would avoid channel overlap if 12.5 kHz channels were interleaved, as an interim measure, with 25 kHz ones; and – the interference potential is likely to be less. Clearly interleaving of channels will need to be carefully planned and the use of frequency planning tools will be important.

Annex 1 Compatibility study of space research/space operations and high density land mobile systems 1 Introduction Sharing between high density and conventional land mobile systems on the one hand and space services on the other hand is not feasible. This Annex is based on contributions which lead to this conclusion and provides the underlying analysis. The mobile system considered in this study is the future public land mobile telecommunication system (FPLMTS). The model used is also applicable to conventional type mobile systems. The bands 2025-2110 GHz and 2200-2290 MHz are intensively used for space operations, Earth exploration by satellite, and space research on a worldwide basis with numerous agreements for international cross-support among space agencies. Due to the long distances between transmitters and receivers, signal levels at the receivers are very low. Consequently these services are very sensitive to interference requiring high protection levels as specified in the RR and ITU-R Recommendations. Figure 1 shows the various links considered and the resulting interference configurations. Only voice services are considered for the personal and mobile stations. Additional interference from base stations has not been studied yet.

    "context": "of mobile services antenna patterns are quasi omnidirectional and the envisaged tens of millions of mobile transmitters have a very high cumulative interference level. As FPLMTS units are \"mobile\" by definition, coordination is not possible for obvious reasons. It can be demonstrated that for practically every configuration considered, sharing with these mobile systems is not feasible. 2 Radio regulatory and band occupation aspects The 2025-2110 MHz and 2200-2290 MHz bands are allocated on a co-primary basis to the SR, SO and EES and the mobile service in all ITU regions. Maximum tolerable interference levels for earth stations are defined in Appendix 7 to the RR, Table 8b and in Recommendations ITU-R SA.363 and ITU-R SA.609. Antenna diagrams for earth stations are based on the radiation patterns specified in Appendix 8 to the RR, Annex III. The minimum elevation angles for earth station antennas are in agreement with RR No. 21.15 and RR No. 21.14. Interference levels for spacecraft receivers are specified in Recommenda- tions ITU-R SA.609 and ITU-R SA.363. In the band 2025-2110 MHz there are currently more than 300 assignments. In the band 2200- 2290MHz the number of assignments is above 350. For the space-to-space links there are currently six allocations for the data relay system with a number of additional ones in progress for the international space station programme as well as for the European and the Japanese data relay satellite programmes. It is apparent that the bands under consideration are heavily used by space services and that a large number of satellites and earth stations would be affected by land mobile services operating in these frequency bands. 3 Land mobile services (FPLMTS) system assumptions A wide range of services is foreseen for future mobile communication systems.

A geostationary spacecraft \"sees\" an area as indicated in Fig. 3with approximately 4 billion people living in it by the year 2000. The minimum orbit height of a spacecraft is 250 km. Figure 4 shows the area seen by a spacecraft flying at orbit heights of 250 km and 750 km, respectively. The interference reception area for a 250 km orbit is already 9.6 million m2. The population living in this area is estimated to more than 600 million people. Figure 5 shows interference reception areas for low inclination orbits around 29° which are typical for space shuttle type orbits. Environmental attenuation for transmission paths through windows, walls, ceilings, buildings and trees have been taken into account for all FPLMTS services. Typical attenuation figures are assumed to be; for windows (6.6 dB), walls and ceilings (27 dB). It was assumed that the signal of most but not all indoor personal units would be attenuated. There will remain a small percentage of terminals which will radiate through open windows, on balconies, terraces or other \"open\" locations. For this study it was assumed that the signal from around 5% of the units is hardly attenuated and from 25% of units attenuated by glass. The interference from the remaining 70% of units was considered insignificant. An average attenuation of 10 dB has consequently been taken into account for indoor personal units. The signals from outdoor personal units and mobile units will only be attenuated if the signal is going through buildings and trees. This is often the case for low elevation angles but less significant for higher angles. Considering that the main interference comes from units close to the subsatellite point, which means high elevation angles, an average attenuation of not more than 3"

E.i.r.p. density levels depend very much on the transmitted data rate. For the SO service the maximum data rate is typically a few kbit/s whereas for the SR service a range from at least 1 kbit/s to 100 kbit/s must be taken into account. Antenna diameter e.i.r.p. range e.i.r.p. density range (m) (dBW) (dB(W/4 kHz)) Protection levels of the FPLMTS units are not known, but the system will be self-interference limited and not noise limited. Assuming that interference levels of around –150 dB(W/4 kHz) are acceptable, and assuming some further loss due to signal diffraction, a protection zone of up to 100 km may be required to allow satisfactory operation of the mobile units. 5.2 Space-to-Earth link (2200-2290 MHz) For these links a distinction between the various space services must be made. The most critical one is space research but results for space operation and Earth exploration are in fact very similar. Assumptions on the distribution of mobile transmitters around a satellite earth station are difficult to make as they depend to a large extent on the location of the station. An average distribution based on the number of inhabitants in the European common market countries has been assumed. The average population density is 140 people per km2 resulting from 323 million people living in 2.3 million km2. The resulting average traffic density is 2.8 E/km2 for personal stations and 0.56 E/km2for mobile stations.

    "explanation": "",
    "context": "beam. A single station transmitting at a distance of 10 km was assumed representative although a much shorter distance is possible. The main conclusion to be drawn is that, even when an average gain specification of a few dBi around the antenna is assumed and a simplified interference calculation unfavourable to the space services is performed, interference levels are produced which are several orders of magnitude above the acceptable levels; hence sharing is impossible. 5.3 Space-to-space link (2025-2110 MHz) The most critical case in this category is the link between a geostationary satellite, for example a data relay satellite, and a low-Earth orbiting satellite. The orbit height of the latter one ranges typically between 250 and 1000 km. Such a link is for example representative for a manned space shuttle which will orbit around 400 km. It is imperative that this spacecraft has an omnidirectional antenna in order to enable safe commanding and communications during every flight phase and in particular in emergency situations. Due to power flux-density limitations on the Earth, a limit is also set on the e.i.r.p. which the data relay satellite may radiate towards the Earth, i.e. towards the low orbiting satellite. This results in very tight link margins. Interference, even at low levels, is extremely critical. The calculated interference levels are so high that any data or communication links to low orbiting spacecraft are totally blanked out. An e.i.r.p. increase on the transmitting geostationary satellite is not feasible due to power flux-density restrictions. Consequently, sharing with land mobiles is impossible.

Orbit heights between 250 and 36000 km have consequently to be taken into account. In principle, the same assumptions as listed above are applicable with the exception that the geostationary satellite uses high gain antennas for the links to the low orbiters. This results in very low acceptable interference levels at the input of the antenna. The beamwidth of the antenna is typically a few degrees so that interference from an area somewhat smaller than for the 250 km orbit can be received. Figure 6 gives a typical example for the area from which interference will be received by a data relay satellite when tracking a low-Earth orbiter.

Annex 3 Description of certain electronic news gathering (ENG) systems operating in the 2025-2110 MHz band 1 Introduction This Annex presents information about the unique technical and operational characteristics used by specific ENG systems operated by one administration that may facilitate sharing with the SR, SO, and EES services. 2 Characteristics/description of ENG systems ENG systems include both mobile point-of-view and transportable ENG systems that provide video from a variety of locations and activities. ENG systems are used for on-location coverage of news events or interviews and live-action video during sports or entertainment events. Because of the value of on-location video, most local television stations in urban areas of the United States of America operate ENG systems. The transportable ENG systems, used for on-location coverage, are generally mounted in vans and operate in a stationary mode transmitting video to a fixed receive site. These systems provide mobility for news coverage throughout a geographic region. 3 ENG systems and environments This section describes two common operational modes. 3.1 Transportable The transportable ENG systems described in the previous section are used for live or taped on- location video for news, sports, and entertainment broadcasts. The transportable ENG systems are generally mounted in vans and use transmitters operating around 10.8 dBW of power. These systems utilize directional antennas with gains between 20-22 dBi mounted on top of a pneumatic mast of up to 15 m in height. ENG systems may employ linear or circular polarization to provide additional interference protection from each"

    "explanation": "",
    "context": "other. Many ENG systems (probably 30-50%) transmit with up to 5 dB of transmission line loss. 3.2 Point-of-view Small light-weight microwave transmitters are used for mobile and close-up video situations since live pictures are desired and because video recorders are impractical due to size and ruggedness requirements. These transmitters usually operate with up to 5 dBW of power. These systems utilize essentially omnidirectional antennas with 0-3 dBi of gain and may also use linear or circular polarization. A small point-of-view system usually operates instead of, rather than in addition to, a transportable ENG operation on the same channel. Point-of-view systems cannot usually operate simultaneously with transportable systems because the transportable systems cause excessive interference to the point-of-view receiver. Table 9 presents characteristics of typical ENG systems that operate in the 2025-2110 MHz band.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "",
    "context": "in the United States of America contain multiple receive sites that allow for simultaneous transmissions on a channel. In most large markets, however, only six simultaneous transmissions are possible on the busiest channel, and in most markets the number does not exceed two. More than two simultaneous transmissions on a single channel rarely occur. In fact, multiple ENG receive sites and systems exist only in the largest television markets, so most regions have little or no simultaneous ENG activity per channel. Although used throughout the day, transportable ENG systems operate primarily during weekday local news broadcasts, which usually occur around 1200-1230, 1700-1900, and 2300-2330 local time. In most markets before the afternoon news hours around 1500-1700, ENG use is also significant. The popularity of local morning shows from 0600-0900 is increasing in various markets, and these shows also use ENG systems. Transportable ENG transmitters are operated approximately twice per day. Broadcast engineers estimate that each ENG operation transmits an average of 15 min per operation but can vary from about 5 min to perhaps as long as 5 h. 5 Spectrum use and characteristics The 1990-2110 MHz band is used as the primary ENG band because of favourable propagation characteristics. These include the lower levels of foliage attenuation that apply at higher frequencies and the ability to \"building bounce\" a signal to achieve a temporary link to a fixed receive site despite unavoidable path blockage. In the United States of America, the ENG frequency band is divided into 7 channels each with 17MHz except the first channel which is 18 MHz as shown in Fig. 8. ENG systems are usually operated at the centre of each channel, but the lower offset and upper offset channels are also used. Consequently, 21 carrier frequencies are possible, but all carrier frequencies cannot be"

    "context": "varies from 9 to15 dB. The maximum distance between the vehicle under test and the telemetry receiving station is usually between 20 and 400 km (the maximum range for some tests is greater than 3000 km). Typical receiver bandwidths vary from 0.5 to 10 MHz (these values are increasing). Receiving system noise temperatures vary between 200 K and 500 K. Main lobe gains of the receiving antennas vary from 6 dBi for some short-range mobile systems to greater than 50 dBi for large antennas. The larger antennas automatically track the test vehicle while the smaller antennas (gain less than 20 dBi) typically are pointed in the direction of the transmitter. The receiving antenna side lobes depend on the size and design of the receiving antenna. The majority of telemetry receiving antennas have diameters between 2.44 m (8 feet) and 10 m (32.8 feet). 3 Spectrum considerations Aeronautical mobile telemetry system providers in the United States of America have divided this band into 90 channels each with a 1 MHz bandwidth. Multiple channels are assigned together when a wider bandwidth is needed. Aeronautical telemetry operations are currently protected by coordination between the various users. The territory of the United States of America is divided into coordination areas. Area frequency coordinators assign and schedule frequency use within these areas. The potential exists for significant interference between satellite earth stations co-located with aeronautical telemetry transmitting sites in the 2200-2290 MHz band. This problem is mitigated by controlling the time, frequency and location of the transmissions by each service in this band. Frequency interference control centres accommodate real-time changes and locate and identify any unauthorized transmissions. A sample radiated power spectral density is shown in Fig. 9. This Figure shows the nominal power spectral density for one telemetry system. The data in this Figure"

ANNEX 1 Methodology 1 Description of methodology To calculate the aggregate pfd from a non-geostationary orbiting satellite (non-GSO) network to a single test location at the GSO, computer modelling of the full non-GSO constellation and a test location at the GSO is needed. Basically, noting that in an ordinary situation a GSO satellite will orbit the geostationary orbit with a period of about TGSO(cid:32) 24 h and that the orbital period of a non-GSO satellite (Tnon-GSO) is not necessarily a submultiple of TGSO, extensive time-consuming statistical simulations may be needed to assess the worst-case scenario that would lead to the maximum pfd level at the GSO location. A simple and very much less time-consuming simulation can be performed to assess the maximum pfd at any GSO location. Instead of a real orbiting GSO satellite, a fixed test location at the GSO is considered whose orbital position is fixed with respect to a 0xyz Cartesian reference system (see Fig. 1) but not with respect to the rotating"

High power amplification of the interfering signal causes spectral side lobe re-growth. The interference contributed by the side lobes is negligible for low values of (cid:39)f, but becomes increasingly significant as the frequency offset is increased. Only the first two side lobes need to be considered. The interference contribution from higher order side lobes is negligible in all practical transmission scenarios. The level of each side lobe is adjusted with respect to the main spectral lobe to reflect the characteristics of the non-linear channel. The relative level of each side lobe comprises two components Lsand X: – A value Ls that is dependent upon the non-linear characteristics of the high power amplifier (HPA) and upon the amplifier’s drive level (backoff). The value of Ls is different for each side lobe. – A value X that represents the effect of filtering at the output of the HPA. This attenuation value is assumed to be the same for all spectral side lobes. This approach is conservative, since the gain of the post-HPA filter is not flat, but rolls off with increasing frequency offset from the channel centre frequency.

The distance is about 600 km for the MPR and 270 km for the RSMS. – The coordination threshold distance for the ALS, MPR and RSMS are not significantly reduced by reducing the maximum allowable emissions from feeder-link earth stations. The method above can be used in conjunction with other mitigation techniques to minimize the separation distances during coordination. 4 Mitigation factors for reducing the separation distance within the coor- dination distance The following considerations should be taken into account where it is necessary for a feeder-link earth station operating in the Earth-to-space direction to be located within the coordination distance: – Typically, feeder-link earth stations will have antenna beamwidths of less than (cid:20)(cid:113) and operate at elevation angles of more than 5(cid:113). This will reduce the e.i.r.p. towards the aeronautical radionavigation station and thus reduce the separation distance. – If the horizontal scan limits of the ALS aircraft landing system do not include the azimuth toward the feeder-link earth station, the air space for the aircraft landing system in not in line with the feeder-link earth station which potentially could reduce the separation distance by up to 100 km. – Use of an earth mound specifically constructed around the feeder-link earth station antenna(s) to provide additional isolation toward the"

Concerning the percentage of observing time lost, one should distinguish between interference from distant transmitters due to variable propagation conditions (i.e. beyond human control) and interference from active applications where the emission is effectively random with respect to the power level and the angle of arrival at a radio telescope (see §3.1).

A number of 2% is given in Recommendation ITU-RRA.1031. However, this does not automatically lead to a 2% data loss for radio astronomy observations. Propagation conditions vary episodically, typically over periods of a few days. It should therefore be noted that over periods of weeks ata time, the period for which data are contaminated by interference may be only a few days. These effects occur primarily at longer wavelengths, i.e. below about 1 GHz. Periods of data loss can be reduced by dynamic rescheduling of radio astronomy observations. 3.1.2 Space-based applications Time variable tropospheric propagation conditions need not be considered under LoS conditions. 3.2 In-band sharing, where the transmission is variable in time and location 3.2.1 Terrestrial applications To maximize the efficiency with which radio telescopes are used, loss of observing time due to interference by other users of the spectrum should be avoided.

Filtering of transmitters and geographical separation are employed to suppress unwanted emission levels into the radio astronomical band to below the RecommendationITU-R RA.769 threshold values at the location of a radio telescope. There is a potential for interference when the radio astronomy beam is pointed closer than 19° to a terrestrial source (seeFig.1). The levels in Recommendation ITU-R RA.769 are based on the assumption that the interference source is at the isotropic contour. As shown in Fig.1, a terrestrial source on the horizon (elevation=0°) can cause detrimental interference in up to 2% of the visible hemisphere for a telescope that can point within 5° of the horizon. However, as a rule, radio telescopes are pointed within 5° of the horizon for only a portion of theirtotal observing time. Some sources of interference are known and can be avoided. In practice, a level of up to 2% data loss could be tolerated from one interfering system. It should be noted that as a radio telescope is pointed at very low elevation angles the system noise increases which reduces the sensitivity. This is not taken into account in Recommendation ITU-R RA.769, since the usual elevation limit of 5°-10° results in very little time being spent in the region of degraded sensitivity.

This may be a rare occurrence in practice. 3.4.6 Summary These calculations show, on the assumption that the pulsed interference does not exceed the Recommendation ITU-R RA.769 detrimental interference threshold for a 2000-second observation, the following: 1) Radar and other pulsed radiation, with periods less than 40s, that average down to the detrimental level at 2000s set by Recommendation ITU-R RA.769 will not cause excess data loss > 2%. 2) For measurements with 40-second observing length, the worst-case pulse strength for >2% excess data loss is 1.5 dB below the system noise, and then only for extremely infrequent pulses (1 in 2000s) in the absence of any mitigation effort that synchronizes data taking in anti-correlation to regular pulses. 3) Aperiodic and/or variable strength interference will cause data loss at or below periodic pulses of constant strength. 4 Conclusions A practical criterion for the aggregate data loss resulting from interference to the RAS is considered to be 5% of time from all sources. The existence of multiple overlapping sources of interference is a practical aspect that should be accounted for. Further study of the apportionment of the aggregate interference between different networks is required. The data loss from any one system should be significantly less than 5%. To comply with this requirement, 2% per system is a practical limit.

This is achieved by avoiding the use of, or vacating, a channel identified as being occupied by radar equipment based on detection of radar signals. For the purpose of this Annex, a discussion of radiodetermination systems in the 5 GHz range utilized in determining DFS characteristics can be found in Annex 3. The implementation of radar detection mechanisms and procedures used by WAS are outside the scope of this Annex. The main reasons for this are that: – WAS design affects implementation; – practical experience may lead to innovative and more efficient means than can be formulated today; – different manufacturers may make different implementation choices to achieve the lowest cost for a given level of performance; therefore only performance criteria rather than specifications for a particular mechanism should be given in regulatory documents. 1 Throughout this Recommendation the term \"WAS\" denotes \"wireless access systems including RLANs\". 2 The DFS feature was specified in the 5 GHz RLAN standards initially in order to mitigate interference among uncoordinated RLAN clusters, and to provide optimized spectral efficiency for high-capacity, high bit-rate data transmission. 2 DFS performance requirements The DFS performance requirement is stated in terms of response to detection of an interference signal. 5 GHz WAS should meet the following detection and response requirements.

This is defined as the received signal strength (RSS) (dBm), normalized to the output of a 0 dBi receive antenna, that is required to be detected within the WAS channel bandwidth. 2.2 Operational requirements The WAS should be able to perform channel availability check: A check during which the WAS listens on a particular radio channel for 60 s to identify whether there is a radar operating on that radio channel. The WAS should be able to perform in-service monitoring: Monitoring of the operating channel to check that a co-channel radar has not moved or started operation within range of the WAS. During in-service monitoring the radar detection function continuously searches for radar signals in-between normal WAS transmissions. This requires the use of quiet spaces between successive WAS transmissions (see Annex 4). If the WAS has not previously been in operation or has not continuously monitored the channel with in-service monitoring, it should not start transmission in any channel before completion of a channel availability check. 2.3 Response requirements A channel that has been flagged as containing a radar signal, either by a channel availability check or in-service monitoring, is subject to a 30 min period (non-occupancy period) where it cannot be used by the WAS device in order to protect scanning radars.

Some parameters have been made available to perform link budget calculations. These are given in Appendix 2 to this Annex. From the calculations, it appears that the necessary detection threshold is equal to –62 dBm to ensure non-interference to the considered radars from a single 1 W WAS device. 5 Possibility of a variable detection threshold In this Annex, the calculations assume a single outdoor WAS with 1 W e.i.r.p., which constitutes a worst-case single interferer analysis. It has been expressed that 1 W e.i.r.p. WAS will not represent the majority of the deployed WAS. Consequently, the idea of a variable detection threshold value which will vary with the WAS e.i.r.p. level may be introduced. According to the methodology used in this Annex, the detection threshold is proportional to the WAS e.i.r.p. According to the methodology used in this Annex for scenarios related to a single WAS device, the detection threshold is proportional to the WAS e.i.r.p.

The spacing between the pulses of an interrogation pulse pair is 12(cid:80)s (Xchannel) or 36(cid:80)s (Y channel). After receiving an interrogator pulse pair a ground station will test the pulse shape and spacing. If these fall within the acceptance limits, it will respond by transmitting a reply after afixed delay with a ±63MHz frequency offset from the interrogation frequency depending on selected channel on pulse code. The beacon has a spacing between the reply pulses of 12(cid:80)s (X channel) and 30(cid:80)s (Y channel). After receipt of the reply, the interrogator will calculate the momentary slant range distance to the beacon from the time elapsed between transmitting interrogation and receiving reply pulse pairs. The beacon will receive interrogations from many aircraft and therefore will send out many replies. Each interrogator creates a unique pattern by varying, within certain limits, the time between the pulse pairs to avoid generation of synchronic replies. By this principle each platform is able to recognize among all pulse pairs the replies that are initiated by its own interrogator. For identification purposes, a TACAN beacon transmits a Morse ID code. The ID tone is used at the airborne interrogators to verify if the range readouts are provided by the correct beacon. Besides the pulse responses, proper reception of the ID tone is also an important condition for TACAN interrogators to properly function. In addition to the range measurements TACAN also offers azimuth bearing information. The bearing information is provided by applying a modulation in the amplitude of the pulses transmitted by the ground beacon. This pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is created using either a mechanically or electronically scanning beacon antenna. The variation in the azimuth pattern in the form of"

Annex 1 Damage and saturation to front end of the SRS deep-space earth station receivers The locations and characteristics of SRS deep-space receivers are described in Recommendation ITU-R SA.1014. The United States of America’s civil space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the European Space Agency (ESA) have provided characteristics of saturation and potential damage levels to their deep-space earth station receivers.

Several mitigation techniques to reduce the unwanted emissions of EESS (active) system in the 8400-8450 MHz SRS deep space band and in the 8450-8500 MHz SRS band are discussed. 1 Protection of SRS space-to-Earth links Recommendation ITU-R SA.1157 gives the protection criterion of deep-space research earth stations as –221 dB(W/Hz) for the SRS frequency band 8400-8450 MHz. The calculation of non-line-of-sight interference due to trans-horizon propagation should be based on weather statistics that apply for 0.001% of the time. Recommendation ITU-R SA.1157 provides the protection criterion for receiver systems in SRS deep-space systems. Compliance to the protection criterion for these assets determines the mission success of SRS deep-space missions. Harmful interference during mission critical events, e.g. orbit insertions, planetary fly-bys, and entry-decent-and-landing (EDL) phases, can cause potential loss of a spacecraft or the loss of irreplaceable data. There are also critical events such as one-time scientific observations where a spacecraft penetrates the atmosphere of a planet or a moon, or it impacts a moon, a planet, an asteroid, or a comet. The spacecraft may be destroyed in the process. The data transmitted during the approach or the moments before and during the impacts define the success of the missions. Therefore, the protection of SRS deep space spacecraft and earth stations during mission critical events, to the extent demanded by Recommendation ITU-R SA.1157, is crucial for the success of SRS deep-space missions. In addition, spacecraft emergencies for deep space systems should be considered as critical events. Additionally, Recommendation ITU-R SA.609 gives the"

The unwanted emissions from the SAR systems are computed based on theoretical roll-off of SAR signals. Higher unwanted emissions are possible if EESS (active) systems include components such as high-efficiency power amplifiers operating in saturation modes. Computation of unwanted emissions of the SAR systems using Annex 8 of Recommendation ITU-R SM.1541 results in higher wanted emissions, and hence, higher interference to the deep-space space-to-Earth links in the frequency band 8 400-8 450 MHz. To compute the attenuation levels needed to protect SRS (deep space) operations and to protect the SRS receivers from damages, the unwanted emissions of EESS (active) hardware, rather than theoretical values, should be used. The level of unwanted emissions falling in the frequency band 8 450-8500 MHz would even be higher due to the reduced frequency separation. Although studies show that there would not be any harmful interference issue for this band, there may be a risk of saturation and damage of the earth station receivers in case of direct illumination, which requires specific mitigation techniques to also apply in this band. 4 Mitigation techniques Several interference mitigating techniques are described in this section. Potential interference from the unwanted emissions of EESS (active) systems can be reduced using one or a combination of some of the techniques described. Generally, the first three techniques, pulse shaping, antenna pointing, and filtering, can significantly reduce the unwanted emissions of EESS"

Compared to a LFM system with 10-ns rise-time and 10-ns fall-time, pulse shaping with trapezoid waveforms and raised-cosine waveforms with 100-ns rise time and 100-ns fall-time can theoretically reduce the unwanted emissions of LFM radars by about 17 dB to 26 dB. Table A2-3 shows that the 100-ns rise-time and 100-ns fall-time trapezoid waveform can reduce the unwanted emission of SAR-1 system to be below the protection level of SRS deep space, although the unwanted emissions of SAR-2 and SAR-3 still exceed the protection level. With the raised-cosine pulse shaping, the unwanted emissions of all three SAR systems are below the protection criterion. It should be noted that imperfections and nonlinearities of various components in the EESS (active) transmit chain will likely increase the unwanted emissions.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "",
    "context": "–34 –25 –12 4.2 Antenna pointing All three SAR systems in Report ITU-R RS.2094 have highly directional antennas. For example, the antenna peak gain of SAR-2 system is between 43 dBi and 46 dBi. The antenna pattern rolls-off quickly in horizontal (or azimuth) direction to –3 dBi. If SAR-2 can point the antenna away from the SRS earth stations such that the antenna gain is –3 dBi towards the SRS earth stations, the unwanted emission of SAR-2 system can be reduced by 46 to 49 dB. Similar technique will also work for SAR-1 and SAR-3 systems. 4.3 Filtering Depending on the implementations of EESS (active) systems, transmit filters and waveguides with steep cut-off below the EESS (active) band can be implemented to limit the unwanted emissions of the systems. Filtering techniques have been successfully implemented by EESS space-to-Earth links in the frequency band 8025-8400 MHz to reduce the unwanted emissions of EESS space-to-Earth links by 40 dB and more in the frequency band 8400-8450 MHz. SAR systems may use phased array antennas which are composed of several hundreds of transmission and receive (TR) modules including high-power amplifiers. Any output filtering would have to be applied to the high power stages of these modules and, thus, increases the system complexity, costs, and performance losses of the radar. However, if needed, an appropriate notch filter may be added in the transmission chain in order to attenuate to the best possible extend the unwanted emissions of the SAR, in a limited bandwidth. 4.4 Selection of sweep range and pulse width The spectral roll-off of the unwanted emission for LFM radar is a function of both the frequency sweep range and the pulse width of the LFM chirp signal.

In the case of radars, for which the bandwidth, as determined using the method above, is greater than 1MHz, a reference bandwidth of 1MHz should be used. (WRC-03) 10 Guidance regarding the methods of measuring spurious domain emissions is given in the most recent version of Recommendation ITU-RSM.329. The e.i.r.p. method specified in this Recommendation should be used when it is not possible to accurately measure the power supplied to the antenna transmission line, or for specific applications where the antenna is designed to provide significant attenuation in the spurious domain. Additionally, the e.i.r.p. method may need some modification for special cases. Specific guidance regarding the methods of measuring spurious domain emissions from radar systems is given in the most recent version of Recommendation To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth in which spurious domain emissions are measured can be different from the reference bandwidth used for specifying spurious domain emission levels.

In these situations, the level of spurious domain emissions from the first transponder is well exceeded by the fundamental or out-of-band domain emissions of the second transponder. Therefore, the limits of this Appendix should not apply to those emissions of a satellite that fall within either the necessary bandwidth or the out-of-band domain of another transponder on the same satellite, in the same service area (see Fig.2). (WRC-03) TranspondersA, B, C andD are operating on the same satellite in the same service area. TransponderA is not required to meet spurious domain emission limits in frequency ranges(cid:111)and(cid:113), but is required to meet them in frequency ranges(cid:110)and(cid:112).

The power P(W) is to be measured in a bandwidth wide enough to include the total mean power. The spurious domain emissions are to be measured in the reference bandwidths given in the relevant ITU-R Recommendations. The measurement of the spurious domain emission power is independent of the value of necessary bandwidth. Because the absolute emission power limit, derived from 43+10log(P), can become too stringent for high-power transmitters, alternative relative powers are also provided in TableI.

The coordination area represents the area surrounding an earth station sharing the same frequency band with terrestrial stations, or the area surrounding a transmitting earth station that is sharing the same bidirectionally allocated frequency band with receiving earth stations, within which the permissible level of interference may be exceeded and hence coordination is required. The coordination area is determined on the basis of known characteristics for the coordinating earth station and on conservative assumptions for the propagation path and for the system parameters for the unknown terrestrial stations (see Tables7 and8), or the unknown receiving earth stations (seeTable9), that are sharing the same frequency band. Throughout this Appendix, the word \"unknown\", when applied to terrestrial stations or earth stations, refers to such stations whose specific operational parameters and potential location within the coordination areaare unknown. (WRC-23) 1.1 Overview This Appendixcontains procedures and system parameters for calculating an earth station’s coordination area, including predetermined distances. The procedures allow the determination of a distance in all azimuthal directions around a transmitting or receiving earth station beyond which the predicted path loss would be expected to exceed a specified value for all but a specified percentage of the time. This distance is called the coordination distance (see No.1.173). When the coordination distance is determined for each azimuth around the coordinating earth station it defines a distance contour, called the coordination contour (seeNo.1.172), thatencloses the coordination area. It is important to note that, although the determination of the coordination area is based on technical criteria, it represents a regulatory concept. Its purpose is to identify the area within which detailed evaluations of the interference potential need to be performed in order to determine whether the coordinating earth station or any of the terrestrial stations, or"

For a transmitting earth station, this is the antenna gain towards the physical horizon on a given azimuth; for a transmitting terrestrial station, the maximum main beam axis antenna gain is to be used Gr: gain (dB relative to isotropic) of the antenna of the receiving terrestrial or earth station that may be subject to interference. For a receiving earth station, this is the gain towards the physical horizon on a given azimuth; for a receiving terrestrialstation, the maximum main beam axis antenna gain is to be used.

For propagation mode (2), a volume scattering process is involved and a modification of the above approach is necessary. Where the coordinating earth station antenna beam intersects a rain cell, a common volume may be formed with a terrestrial station beamor an earth station beam (operating in the opposite direction of transmission in bidirectionally allocated frequency bands). In the case of a terrestrial station, the assumptions are made that the terrestrial station beamwidth is relatively large in comparison with that of the coordinating earth station (terrestrial station gain values are given in Tables 7 and 8) and that the terrestrial station is some distance from the common volume.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "",
    "context": "rain cell, which is represented by a vertical cylinder filled with hydrometeors that give rise to isotropically scattered signals. This scattering process may give rise to unwanted coupling between the coordinating earth station and terrestrial stations or other earth stations operating in bidirectionally allocated frequency bands, via the common volume. The earth station antenna gain and its beamwidth are interdependent. The size of the common volume, and the number of scattered signals arising within that volume, increases as the gain of the earth station antenna transmitting or receiving those signals decreases, the one effect compensating for the other. A term which approximates the full integral required to evaluate the volume scattering process within the earth station antenna beam is included in equation (72). Therefore in the procedure for evaluation of interference that may arise from propagation mode(2) mechanisms a simplifying assumption can be made that the path loss is independent of the earth station antenna gain2. Hence for propagation mode (2), equation (1) reduces to: Lx(p) = Pt+Gx–Pr(p) dB (2) where: Lx(p): minimum loss required for propagation mode (2) Gx: maximum antenna gain (dBi) assumed for the terrestrial station.

The remainder of the path along each radial is considered to be flat and therefore free of additional diffraction losses. – Tropospheric scatter: This mechanism defines the \"background\" interference level for pathslonger than about100km, beyond which the diffraction field becomes very weak. – Surface ducting: This is the most important short-term interference mechanism over water and in flat coastal land areas, and can give rise to high signal levels over greater distances, sometimes exceeding 500km. Such signals can exceed the equivalent \"free-space\" level under certain conditions. – Elevated layer reflection and refraction: The treatment of reflection and/or refraction from layers at heights of up to a few hundred metres is an important mechanism that enables signals to by-pass any diffraction losses due to the underlying terrain under favourable path geometry situations. Here again, the impact can be significant over long distances. – Hydrometeor scatter: Hydrometeor scatter can be a potential source of interference between terrestrial station transmitters and earth stations because it may act isotropically, and can therefore have an impact irrespective of whether the common volume is on or off the great-circle interference path between the coordinating earth station and terrestrial stations, or other receiving earth stations operating in bidirectionally allocated frequency bands. In this Appendix, propagation phenomena are classified into two modes as follows: – Propagation mode (1): propagation phenomena in clear air (tropospheric scatter, ducting, layer reflection/refraction, gaseous absorption and site shielding). These phenomena are confined to propagation along the great-circle path. – Propagation mode (2): hydrometeor scatter. 1.5.1 Propagation mode (1) For the determination of the propagation mode (1) required distances, the applicable frequency range has been divided into three parts: –"

The sharing scenarios and the various procedures contained in this Appendixare based on different assumptions. Hence, the coordination area developed for one sharing scenario is likely to be based on different sharing considerations, interference paths and operational constraints than the coordination area developed under a different sharing scenario. Separate coordination areas are therefore required for each sharing scenario described in §1.4, and each coordination area is specific to the radiocommunication services covered by the sharing scenario under which it was developed. Further, the coordination area developed for one sharing scenario cannot be used to determine the extent of any impact on the radiocommunication services covered by a different sharing scenario. Thus, a coordinating earth station operating in a bidirectionally allocated frequency band that is also allocated to terrestrial services will have two separate coordination areas: – one coordination area for determining those administrations with terrestrial services that may be affected by the operation of the coordinating earth station; and – one coordination area for determining those administrations with receiving earth stations that may be affected by the operation of the coordinating (transmitting) earth station. This means that the establishment of the coordination area for an earth station will generally require the determination of several individual coordination areas, each drawn on a separate map. For example, an earth station which transmits to a geostationary space station in the band 10.7-11.7GHzwill"

    "context": "Annex 6 can be used to generate supplementary contours for earth stations operating with non- geostationary space stations. Auxiliary contours are based on less conservative assumptions, with regard to the interference path and operational constraints, for the unknown terrestrial stations, or earth stations. Auxiliary contours are developed separately for propagation mode (1) and propagation mode (2) interference paths. In this context, the contours from which the coordination contour was developed are called main contours, and the auxiliary contours for propagation mode (1) and propagation mode (2) are referenced to the appropriate main contour. The various assumptions used for developing auxiliary contours to the propagation mode (1) contour, or the propagation mode (2) contour, can also be applied to supplementary contours.Hence, auxiliary contours may be drawn for both a main or a supplementary contour. Supplementary contours are always drawn on a separate map as they apply to other types of radio system within the same radiocommunication service, or to radio systems in different radiocommunication services. However, as auxiliary contours apply to the various assumptions used in developing the main, or supplementary, contour they are always drawn on the same map that contains the corresponding main, or supplementary, contour. While the use of supplementary or auxiliary contours allows less conservative assumptions with regard to the interference path and operational constraints to be taken into consideration, earth stations may transmit or receive a variety of classes of emissions. Hence, the earth station parameters to be used in the determination of the coordination contour, and any supplementary or auxiliary contours, are those which lead to the greatest distances for each earth station antenna beam and each allocated frequency band which the coordinating earth station shares with other radiocommunication systems. 2 Determination of the earth station coordination area with respect to terrestrial stations This section"

These procedures cover the cases for earth stations operating with space stations in the geostationary orbit, or in non-geostationary orbits, and are described in the following subsections. For earth stations operating with space stations in non-geostationary orbits, consideration has to be given to the potential time-varying nature of the earth station’s antenna gain towards the horizon. 2.1 Earth stations operating with geostationary space stations For an earth station operating with a geostationary space station, the value of GtandGrtowards the horizon is considered to be constant with time. The percentage of time associated with Lb in equation(1) is the same as the time percentage, p, associated with Pr(p). When determining the coordination area between a coordinating earth station operating with a geostationary space station and terrestrial systems, the coordination distance on any azimuth is the greater of the propagation mode(1) and propagation mode(2) required distances. The required distances for propagation mode(1) and propagation mode(2) are determined using the procedures described in §2.1.1 and §2.1.2 respectively, after taking into consideration the following discussion on station-keeping. When the north/south station-keeping of a geostationary space station is relaxed, the orbit of the space station becomes inclined with an inclination that increases gradually with time. This movement of the space station from its nominal position may require small corresponding adjustments in the elevation angle of the earth station antenna beam. Hence, to avoid considering the time variation in antenna gain in the direction of the horizon, the coordination area of an earth station operating with a space station in a slightly inclined geostationary orbit is determined for the minimum angle of elevation and the associated azimuth at which the space station is visible to the"

The characteristics of terrestrial systems depend on the frequency band, and the value of the correction factor to be applied follows the frequency dependence given in equation(20). At frequencies between 100MHz and 400MHz, and between 60GHz and 105GHz, sharing between earth stations and terrestrial systems is a recent development and there is little established practical experience, or opportunity to analyse operational systems. Hence, the value of the correction factor is 0dB in these bands. Between 400MHz and 790MHz and between 4.2GHz and 60GHz, the value of the correction factor is reduced in proportion to the logarithm of the frequency, as indicated in equation(20). The value of the nominal correction to be used at any frequency f(GHz) is therefore given by: where: X: 15dB for a transmitting earth station and 25dB for a receiving earth station. In principle, the value of the nominal correction factor, X(f), is distance and path independent. However, there are a number of issues relating to interference potential at the shorter distances, and it is not appropriate to apply the full nominal correction at these distances. The correction factor Ciis therefore applied proportionally with distance along the azimuth under consideration, starting with 0dB at dmin, such that the full value of X(f) is achieved at a nominal distance of 375km from the earth station. Hence, the correction is applied using the correction constant Z(f) (dB/km) where: X(f) min The correction factor Ci(dB) is calculated in equations(28b) and(52) from the correction constant Z(f) (dB/km). At distances greater than 375km, the correction factor Cito be applied is the value of Ciat 375km distance. In addition, the correction factor is applied to its highest value only on land paths.

This distribution needs to be developed for a predetermined set of values of horizon antenna gain spanning the range from the minimum to the maximum values for the azimuth under consideration. The notation Ge(pn) denotes the value of horizon antenna gain for which the complement of the cumulative distribution of the horizon antenna gain has the value corresponding to the percentage of time pn. The pnvalue is the percentage of time that the horizon antenna gain exceeds the n-th horizon antenna gain value. The procedure in §4.1 may be used to develop this distribution. For each value of pn, the value of horizon antenna gain for this time percentage, Ge(pn), is used in equation(123) to determine a propagation mode(1) minimum required loss. The propagation mode(1) predicted path loss is to exceed this propagation mode(1) required loss for no more than pv% of the time, as specified by the constraint associated with equation(123).
